Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires phpunit/phpunit ^11.0, found phpunit/phpunit[11.0.0, ..., 11.5.44] but the package is fixed to 12.4.2 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
You can also try re-running composer require with an explicit version constraint, e.g. "composer require twig/markdown-extra:*" to figure out if any version is installable, or "composer require twig/markdown-extra:^2.1" if you know which you need.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.
